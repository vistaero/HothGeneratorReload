#
# All world configuration has been moved into worldConfig.yml 
# You do not need to edit the worldConfig.yml file manually.
#
# Instead you can configure it using these commands:
#
# Add a new world to the configuration:
#
# /hothaddworld worldname [hoth|tatooine|dagobah]
#
# Delete a world from the configuration
#
# /hothdelworld worldname
#
# Change the world type of a hoth world
#
# /hothsetworldtype worldname [hoth|tatooine|dagobah]
#
# Set a flag for a hoth world
#
# /hothsetworldflag world flag value
#
# Prints information about a hoth world. Exclude worldname for a list of worlds
#
# /hothworldinfo worldname
#
# --- Advanced options ---
#
# There's no need to change anything of the following unless there's
# some game mechanics you really want to change. If you want to play
# the worlds as the author intended, just leave the following as is.
#
# If you should mess up the config then just stop the server, remove the
# config file and then start the server again.
#
# Almost all options can be overridden per world by using the /hothsetworldflag
# command. This is useful if you want specific rules for each world. Like one hoth
# world with spikes, and one without.
#
# Do note that not all options are valid for all world types.
# Some examples:
#   Ice spikes can only be generated in hoth type worlds
#   Freeze damage is only available in hoth type worlds
#   Oasises are only available in tatooine type worlds
#   Tree huts are only available in dagobah worlds
#   .. etc ..
#
# Worldguard regions can also override a lot of these options by using the
# hothregion command.
